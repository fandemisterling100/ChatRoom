1. Install the packages required via:
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  To use the Redis and RabbitMQ services we will use docker containers (Be sure your docker daemon is running):

	- `$ docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5`
	
	- `$ docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672rabbitmq:3-management`

3.   Make migrations and migrate them to create the db.sqlite3 on your project directory (being inside chat_app folder):
	`$ python manage.py makemigrations chatroom`

	`$ python manage.py migrate`
	
4. Serve page:

	`$ python manage.py runserver`

5.  Create bot user by clicking on **Register Here** and filling the fields according to the following information:

	```javascript
	USER_DATA = {
		"username": "Bot",
		"email": "bot@email.com",
		"password": "1234" 
		}
	```

6. LogOut

## Usage üßë‚Äçüíª
1. Move to folder `/chat_app/decoupled_bot` and run the decoupled bot to start to consume from the stock queue:
 `python3 -m bot_package.consumers`
 
2. Return to folder `/chat_app/` and serve the page (if it was not being served) via: `$ python manage.py runserver`

3. Now you can register on the page your own users and Log them in.
4. To get into a chat room just type a valid room name (alphanumeric value) from the index page (redirected when you log in) and click on **Join**.
