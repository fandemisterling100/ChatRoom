3.  To use the Redis and RabbitMQ services we will use docker containers (Be sure your docker daemon is running):

    	 `$ sudo apt install docker.io` (If you don't have Docker installed) 

	 `$ sudo dockerd`

	 `$ sudo docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5`

	 `$ sudo docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management`


4.   Make migrations and migrate them to create the db.sqlite3 on your project directory (being inside `ChatRoom/` folder):

	 `$ python manage.py makemigrations chatroom`

	 `$ python manage.py migrate`

5. Serve page:

	`$ python manage.py runserver`

6.  Create bot user by clicking on **Register Here** and filling the fields according to the following information:

	```javascript
	USER_DATA = {
		"username": "Bot",
		"email": "bot@email.com",
		"password": "1234" 
		}
	```

7. LogOut

## Usage üßë‚Äçüíª
1. Move to folder `decoupled_bot/` and run the decoupled bot to start to consume from the stock queue:
 `python3 -m bot_package.consumers`
 
2. Return to folder `ChatRoom/` and serve the page (if it was not being served) via: `$ python manage.py runserver`

3. Now you can register on the page your own users and Log them in.
